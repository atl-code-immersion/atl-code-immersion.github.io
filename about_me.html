			Tech Talent South is proud to call Atlanta our first home. This amazing tech and startup haven has allowed us to grow and become the code school that we are today. Our coding courses take place at Strongbox West, the largest coworking space in the southeast that boasts incredible meeting spaces and a video arcade. In the neighborhood is Georgia Tech and its accelerator program Flashpoint, along with ATDC one of the countryâ€™s best technology incubators. This West Midtown location allows easy access to all the exciting happenings in the ATL tech scene.
